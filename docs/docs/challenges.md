# Technical Challenges

This section outlines the technical challenges faced during the development of the Crypto Price Tracker and how they were addressed.

## Real-time Data Updates

### Challenge
Maintaining real-time price updates without overwhelming the API or the client's browser.

### Solution
- Implemented WebSocket connections for live updates
- Added configurable update intervals
- Created a caching layer to reduce API calls

## Performance Optimization

### Challenge
Handling large amounts of cryptocurrency data while maintaining smooth performance.

### Solution
- Implemented virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimized React component rendering
- Added client-side caching

## API Rate Limiting

### Challenge
Working within API rate limits while providing timely data updates.

### Solution
```typescript
class RateLimiter {
  private queue: Array<() => Promise<any>> = [];
  private processing = false;
  private requestsPerMinute: number;

  constructor(requestsPerMinute: number) {
    this.requestsPerMinute = requestsPerMinute;
  }

  async processQueue() {
    if (this.processing) return;
    this.processing = true;

    while (this.queue.length > 0) {
      const request = this.queue.shift();
      if (request) {
        await request();
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 60000 / this.requestsPerMinute));
      }
    }

    this.processing = false;
  }
}
```

## State Management

### Challenge
Managing complex application state across multiple components.

### Solution
- Implemented Redux for global state management
- Created custom hooks for local state
- Used context for theme and user preferences

## Error Handling

### Challenge
Gracefully handling API errors and network issues.

### Solution
- Implemented comprehensive error boundaries
- Added retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Created user-friendly error messages

## Future Challenges

- Implementing additional cryptocurrency exchanges
- Adding advanced trading features
- Supporting multiple fiat currencies
- Enhancing mobile experience
